# database-manager

This project uses connection to a database using Spring. The database includes products (for example, that can be found in a supermarket) and Clothing products. After running the application, the user would have to pick which field he/she is interested in, and, after that, choose a CRUD operation on the database. The database is automatically updated and its content can be listed each time.
